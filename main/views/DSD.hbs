                    <p>This tool maintains a small repository of school books. It could track books, classes and
                        students who check out books. And staff shall manage books information and teacher shall check
                        out the book that they teach.</p>
                    <h4 id="chapter1-1">1.1 Goals and objectives</h4>
                    <p>This tool maintains a repository of school books. The main goals of this application is to build
                        a small repository of school books which support different kinds of operations for users.
                        The objective of this software development lies in how well the requirements are understood and
                        how this can be developed using proper planned phases in different modules. The application
                        shall track books, classes and students who check out books. Each book has a unique school
                        generated ID. A total number of books shall be tracked. The ability to add/update/delete all
                        information is required. Numeric key fields should be automatically generated. Such as book ID,
                        Student Id, Staff ID. Security is required.</p>
                    <p>All users must be granted access to the system before they can use it. Access must be based on
                        levels. The system must respond to all requests within 5 seconds. The application shall list
                        all students with books checked out showing due date and date checked out. List all users and
                        their access level. List all books in the system with search capabilities. To list all orders
                        by order type (PC Repair Orders, etc.). List of all books checked out by class or book
                        name/number. List of students and parents info with amount due. </p>
                    <p>What’s more, each Book is identified with an ISBN number and unique school generated number.
                        Each student shall check out up to the number of classes he/she is registered for. Each
                        staff/teacher is assigned a unique user ID and an ID. Books data needs to be stored in a
                        database of some sort and the data shall be obtained from an online web service
                        (google books, Amazon or any other source). Each class the school offer must be recorded in
                        the database.</p>

                    <h4 id="chapter1-2">1.2 Statement of scope</h4>
                    <p>The tool is mainly used in a school’s library. </p>
                    <p>It could track books, classes, students and teachers who check out books. </p>
                    <p>The essential goal is to track books by ISBN, to track students and teachers by ID. The desirable
                        goal is to count the number of books checked out, and those left in the library. The future goal
                        is to apply this tool into multiple platform in a different context, like hospital counting
                        medicine, police station counting guns, etc.</p>
                    <p>The Scope of the Project is to provide an interface to the customers that can interact with the
                        system on a web based form which generates the list of order or repairs etc. to the
                        administrator and also to the customer. This kind of format is very reasonable to manage and
                        maintain for both administrator and to the customer.</p>
                    <p>The List of major inputs, processing, etc. is presented below and their ranks are also specified.</p>
                    <p>The application shall be accessible through a web browser such as chrome, Firefox, Safari and so
                        on. It shall prompt the user for a username and password. Upon entering this information
                        correctly, the user shall have access to the repository of school books.</p>
                    <p>For the users, they shall be able to search and check out books which is essential for the
                        course. In additional, the users shall able to view the capabilities of books. Most importantly,
                        the user shall be able to view the current state of the orders.</p>
                    <p>The users shall do this by requesting a report from the system. The report shall display,
                        according to the type of report requested, either:
                    </p>
                    <p>1.All students with books checked out showing due date and date checked out.</p>
                    <p>2.All authorized users and their access level.</p>
                    <p>3.All books in the system with search capabilities.</p>
                    <p>4.All orders by order type.</p>
                    <p>5.All books checked out by class or book name/number.</p>
                    <p>In the case that a new book is offered by the store, the administrator shall have the capability
                        to add new items into the repository for tracking. To help maintain the current repository
                        state, the administrator shall have the ability to update the quantity of books in repository
                        when books are checked out. In order to update the information, the administrator will have to
                        enter the number of books checked out, the due date. The administrator shall also be able to
                        delete books in the case that they are no longer offered. Every book shall be differentiated by
                        an ISBN number. Similar codes shall be created for the purpose of identifying students and
                        teachers.</p>
                    <p>In the case that a student or a teacher contact information should change, the administrator
                        shall be able to update the contact information for the students or teachers. The administrator
                        shall also have the ability to delete information of students or teachers.The administrator
                        shall be able to add, update, and delete order information in the same way that he/she is able
                        to do for a customer's information. In additional, the administrator shall search all the access
                        level of authorized users and shall view all books checked out by class or book name/number.</p>
                    <p>The customer list shall be maintained in a similar way to the books. When a student or teacher
                        wants to check out some books, the system will list all the information of books through
                        searching by book’s name or ISBN number. When students or teachers check out some books, system
                        will automatically decrease the amount of books in the tracking portion of the system for
                        repository. Students shall able to view the due date and the date checked out of books they
                        checked out and check our up to the number of  classes he/she is registered for through
                        entering their ID.</p>

                    <p>The software is used to check and order books in a high school efficiently. It is a web based
                        application which basically consists of 3 tier architecture. Application server (Node.js) will
                        mainly handle the web application.</p>
                    <p>The application will communicate to the database (MongoDB)
                        to communicate and retrieve information. Users shall use a browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari) to
                        access the application. With the growing number of the users, in order to keep track of the
                        changes to its books, the system shall not only allow multiple users to maintain an up-to-date

                        borrow (check out) the book and the other users who return them. </p>
                    <p>The system will help control the management process of the repository by keeping current contact
                        information for students, parents, teachers and staffs. The students and the parents can be the
                        main users who can borrow (check out), return their books and update their information.
                        The teachers shall borrow (check out) more books than students and parents.
                        The staffs shall manage the book information or inventory. Also, they can control the whole system.

                    <h4 id="chapter1-4">1.4 Major constraints</h4>
                    <p>The major constraints in the development are that the system should respond within the required
                        constraint described in the project manual. The software is developed keeping in mind about the
                        needs of the customer and their interaction between the system. </p>
                    <p>The software is designed to give the best efficiency possible. It is also organized to fix quick
                        errors or bugs.</p>

                    <h3 id="chapter2">2. Data Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        This part will describe the data structure including internal, global, and temporary data
                        structures.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="chapter2-1">2.1 Internal software data structure</h4>
                    <p>
                        High School Book Tracking web application’s internal structure is divided into two different
                        main parts: Server-side and Client-side. </p>
                    <p>For our Server-side, the data of the user information, book information and book inventory will
                        be stored in our local database. The functionality of the storage will be accomplished using a
                        MongoDB database. The data structure in the server will be handled in which defined based on the
                        classes in requirement document and later. </p>
                    <p>The Server side will be implemented by Node.js and Express back-end Framework. </p>
                    <p>The class will be isolated in model module, The businesses and functionality will be controlled
                        in Controller module, The view skeleton will be implemented in View module. Therefore, The data
                        flowing will be handled by way of MVC (Model-View-Controller) System.</p>
                    <p>The server side (Express) and the client-side (web browser) will exchange data in two ways: The First way
                        is back-end Controller will render needed data for View which is for initialization, The Second way is back-end
                        Controller sending data using JSON format which is for the huge amount of data.</p>
                    <p>The client side exchange data mainly using the JSON based RESTful. The JSON is a versatile data
                        object format which already dominated a web development. The client-side as web page mainly
                        manipulated by javascript, exchange by AJAX.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="chapter2-2">2.2 Global data structure</h4>
                    <p>The global data structure of book tracking web application is characterized by the MongoDB database.
                        The client-side (web browser) shall never access this database directly, it shall be able to
                        make requests to our server side and get the data safely. The architecture of the data structure
                        reveals the data is that the app need in its purest sense.</p>
                    <h4 id="chapter2-3">2.3 Temporary data structure</h4>
                    <p>The temporary data will be mainly exist in our client-side which is a web browser. There will be
                        two mainly data objects’ type in our web browser. The one is cookie saved in the user’s browser
                        to temporarily manipulate the user local data. The other is session saved on the machine to
                        temporarily manage the login state. Those Temporary data will help us to refine and improve our
                        application by lowering data exchange and front-end rely.</p>
                    <h4 id="chapter2-4">2.4 Database description</h4>
                    <p>The Database will be preserved by MongoDB. The MongoDB as a document oriented database will have
                        a lot of different features compare with traditional relational database.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> The document oriented database can essentially provide a flexible JSON structure.
                        <li> The document oriented database don’t have to make a rigorous initialization.
                        <li> The document oriented database don’t have “relation” which means no more relational join
                            or limit. All relation from business oriented can be solved by ID and flexible structure.
                    </ol>
                    <p>It’s a very powerful database for web development based on Node.js.
                    Here is our ERD Diagram on requirement specification document.
                        So we can divide as 5 tables.</p>

                    <h2 id="chapter4-2">4.2 Interface design rules</h2>

                    <p>The interfaces of this web application called “Book tracking system” are based on the Ben Shneiderman’s “Eight
                        Golden Rules of Interface Design”. The details of eight rules are shown as below:</p>

                    <h3 id="chapter4-2-1">4.2.1 Strive for consistency.</h3>

                    <p>Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations; identical terminology should be used in
                        prompts, menus, and help screens; and consistent commands should be employed throughout.
                        In this web application, all contents are arranged in left side or in the central of the webpage.</p>

                    <h3 id="chapter4-2-2">4.2.2 Enable frequent users to use shortcuts.</h3>

                    <p>As the frequency of use increases, so do the user's desires to reduce the number of interactions and to increase
                        the pace of interaction. Abbreviations, function keys, hidden commands, and macro facilities are very helpful to
                        an expert user. In this web application, buttons are used for making user finish the task quickly.</p>

                    <h3 id="chapter4-2-3">4.2.3 Offer informative feedback.</h3>

                    <p>For every operator action, there should be some system feedback. For frequent and minor actions, the response can
                        be modest, while for infrequent and major actions, the response should be more substantial. This web application
                        will give feedbacks when the user finish the operation. When some errors happen, the user will receive the message.</p>

                    <h3 id="chapter4-2-4">4.2.4 Design dialog to yield closure.</h3>

                    <p>Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end. The informative feedback
                        at the completion of a group of actions gives the operators the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief,
                        the signal to drop contingency plans and options from their minds, and an indication that the way is clear to
                        prepare for the next group of actions.</p>

                    <h3 id="chapter4-2-5">4.2.5 Offer simple error handling.</h3>

                    <p>As much as possible, design the system so the user cannot make a serious error. If an error is made, the system
                        should be able to detect the error and offer simple, comprehensible mechanisms for handling the error.
                        If user do not input the available information, the note will show the user why the information is unavailable.</p>

                    <h3 id="chapter4-2-6">4.2.6 Permit easy reversal of actions.</h3>

                    <p>This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone; it thus encourages exploration of
                        unfamiliar options. The units of reversibility may be a single action, a data entry, or a complete group of actions.
                        The staff users have the highest authority which can help the teachers and students  modify some operation errors.</p>

                    <h3 id="chapter4-2-7">4.2.7 Support internal locus of control.</h3>

                    <p>Experienced operators strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the system and that the system responds
                        to their actions. Design the system to make users the initiators of actions rather than the responders.
                        As highest manager, staff users will control the system if it is necessary.</p>

                    <h3 id="chapter4-2-8">4.2.8 Reduce short-term memory load.</h3>

                    <p>The limitation of human information processing in short-term memory requires that displays be kept simple, multiple
                        page displays be consolidated, window-motion frequency be reduced, and sufficient training time be allotted for
                        codes, mnemonics, and sequences of actions.
                        Each menu is designed for a single task which make every operation is easy understood by the user.</p>

                    <h2 id="chapter4-3">4.3 Components available</h2>

                    <p>The Bootstrap provides plenty of GUI components. The web application will use many of them including the following:</p>

                    <h3 id="chapter4-3-1">4.3.1 Tables</h3>

                    <p>Tables are using for showing some information on the webpage, such as book information and user information.</p>

                    <h3 id="chapter4-3-2">4.3.2 Input groups</h3>

                    <p>Extend form controls by adding text or buttons before, after, or on both sides of any text-based <input>.</p>

                    <h3 id="chapter4-3-3">4.3.3 Button</h3>

                    <p>This web application will use buttons as events driven. Each menu will have its own button to interact with users.</p>

                    <h3 id="chapter4-3-4">4.3.4 TextView</h3>

                    <p>The TextView components allow webpage show text in a linear way.</p>

                    <h2 id="chapter4-4">4.4 UIDS description</h2>

                    <p>The user interface development system is provided by bootstraps.
                        Our UIDS uses many components from bootstraps. But the graphical components in bootstraps is not enough, so much of
                        the components were designed by ourselves modifying the html codes.
                        Every function in the menu will be implemented by using Javascript.</p>

                    <h2 id="chapter5">5.0 Restrictions, limitations, and constraints</h2>

                    <ul>
                    <li>The interactions between the client web browser and the server shall take the time within 5 seconds.
                    <li>And Since the deployment will be running our server locally, the user from other networking can’t be able to access our system.
                    <li>We only allow one high school to use our web application.
                    <li>We don't allow the user over thousand since the database and the server will not be able to handle the huge amount user’s data.
                    <li>What we focus is on how to organize the book and students and make the book tracking system.
                    <li>We might not allow people to register as a new staff since the level restriction.
                    <li>Our product can’t not be deployed to the marketplace since the limited functionality and server size.</ul></p>

                        The two most critical components of the book tracking application - Server-side and Client-side.
                    <ul>
                    <li>For our Server-side, Without proper setup and interaction with database. Our website will be rendered useless
                        information or crush. The testing must be done and ensure the validation of the server. And the information
                        before writing in the database must be verified.

                    <li>For our Client-side, We have to ensure the data sending to the server shall be verified by Client-side Script
                        before entering the server. The view of Client-side shall clearly show the consistency of information provided
                        by the server.
